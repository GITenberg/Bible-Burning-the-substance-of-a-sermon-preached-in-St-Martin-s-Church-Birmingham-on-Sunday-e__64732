<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;<i>And there was a fire on the
hearth burning before him</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And it came to pass</i>, <i>that when Jehudi had
read three or four leaves</i>, <i>he cut it with the penknife and
cast it into the fire that was on the hearth</i>, <i>until all
the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the
hearth</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> among the vast multitude which
is now thronging this sacred building, there be one who has come
up hither with the expectation that it would be my object to
excite or fan a flame of bitter hostility against the members of
the Church of Rome, I trust that he will be disappointed.</p>
<p>If there be any who have come up hither from a feeling of idle
curiosity, it is my earnest prayer that they may not leave this
Church without obtaining a blessing, though unsought by
themselves.</p>
<p>It <i>is now</i>, my beloved Brethren, and it <i>has been</i>
this day, my earnest and heartfelt prayer that, while I discharge
what, perhaps mistakenly, yet conscientiously, I feel to be my
bounden duty, I may not forget that I am called upon as a
minister of Christ to manifest the spirit of my Master; and that
while I speak <i>the truth</i>, I may do it <i>in love</i>.&nbsp;
And if, at the close of this discourse, my memory should recall
one bitter expression towards the members of that Church whose
corruptions I feel it my duty to expose, no one in this
congregation could deplore it more than the preacher himself.</p>
<p>May God, in His infinite mercy, send down His blessing on my
present endeavours!&nbsp; May He send on us the spirit of
candour, the spirit of love, the spirit of faithfulness, that
while we strive, as far as in us lies, to &ldquo;live peaceably
with all men,&rdquo; we may not forget that there is one thing
dearer than peace&mdash;<span class="smcap">His Truth</span>!</p>
<p>I shall say but little on the text itself.&nbsp; The roll
which is here spoken of as having been cut and consumed by
Johoiakim was written, as you will observe from the previous
context, by Baruch, at the dictation of Jeremiah, a prophet
inspired of God; and contained God&rsquo;s threatenings against
the corrupt and degenerate Jews.&nbsp; When this roll had been
read in the hearing of the king, his conduct was that which is
narrated in the text.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Without
further reference to my text, I conceive that the most open and
honourable manner in which I can proceed is, first to read to you
the simple account of the circumstance which has given rise to
the delivery of this discourse.&nbsp; Some of my own dear people
will remember with gratitude the ministrations of one of the
Clergy in this town, now the Incumbent of St. Peter&rsquo;s
Church, who was for some months the senior Curate of this
parish.&nbsp; That gentleman, I need not say to you, is of such
unimpeachable integrity and Christian character as not to admit
of any doubt of the truth of his public statement.&nbsp; A little
girl attending the Free Industrial School which has been set on
foot by my beloved and zealous brother the Rector of St.
Philip&rsquo;s, became possessed, it does not appear by what
means, of a copy of the Protestant authorised version of the New
Testament.&nbsp; To this Testament Mr. Greaves&rsquo;s Letter has
reference.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
the Editor of Aris&rsquo;s Gazette</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;I see in your paper of
last Monday a statement that a Testament was burnt by a Priest of
the Church of Rome in a house in London &rsquo;Prentice-street,
in this town.</p>
<p>I had written you a letter on the subject immediately on its
occurrence; but upon consulting with the Hon. and Rev. Grantham
M. Yorke, Rector of Saint Philip&rsquo;s, in whose Free
Industrial Schools the Testament in question had been given to a
little girl, I determined first, if possible, to obtain the
admission of the Priest to what passed between us in
conversation.&nbsp; As, however, publicity has been given to the
occurrence before I have had time to carry out my plans, I think
it best, as the Minister of the district in which London
&rsquo;Prentice-street is situated, to write to you at once, and
say that the statement is strictly true.&nbsp; The Priest
acknowledged to me that he burnt the Testament, and also declared
that he would burn every Bible or Tract which he found in the
houses of any of his people.&nbsp; He also charged me never again
to enter the house of a Romanist in my district; and upon my
assuring him that I should pay no attention to his command, and
that the law of the land would protect my person, he said he
would order his people to use &ldquo;scurrilous&rdquo; language
towards me, and to offer me insult, if I ventured to pass their
doors.&nbsp; Upon my appealing to him, and asking &ldquo;how he
dared to burn the Word of God?&rdquo; he told me &ldquo;to go and
preach in my pulpit, and not to preach to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
merely state facts, and leave your readers to draw their own
inferences from them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I remain, Sir, your obedient
servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">JOSHUA GREAVES,<br />
Incumbent of St. Peter&rsquo;s, Birmingham.</p>
<p>November 29, 1848.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I have no desire to act dishonourably or uncandidly, and
therefore I feel it to be my duty to read a document put forth by
the body of Roman Catholic Priests in this town, in reference to
the above letter.&nbsp; It was published in our local paper of
yesterday morning.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We, the Catholic Clergy of Birmingham,
having seen it stated in a letter from the Rev. Joshua Greaves,
that one of our body had burnt a copy of the Protestant version
of the New Testament, found in the house of a Catholic, have no
hesitation at once to admit the fact; but wish at the same time
to add <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>that
the act was regretted afterwards by the Clergyman by whom it was
done, and strongly disapproved of by his brother Clergy, as soon
as known.&nbsp; Justice, however, requires us to state that the
Catholics of Birmingham had suffered constant and great annoyance
from the interference of certain Protestant Clergymen or others,
their agents, who frequently intrude themselves into the houses
of poor Catholics, unsought for and uninvited, for the purpose of
perverting their faith.&nbsp; It was with the knowledge that such
a system was going on, and under the excitement of the moment,
that the act, which it is not attempted to justify, was
done.&nbsp; We take this opportunity of stating that the Catholic
version of the Sacred Scriptures is considered by us as the only
one authorised for circulation amongst our own people.</p>

<p>St. Chad&rsquo;s, Birmingham, Dec. 7, 1848.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The signatures include that of the priest who burned the
Testament. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Now I
have no doubt that two objections to my sermon will arise in many
minds.&nbsp; First, I can quite imagine that some persons who are
here, and many more perhaps who are absent to-night, may be
disposed to say, &ldquo;Is it not unfair&rdquo;&mdash;(I am now
speaking of an objection which might have been urged previous to
the published statement of the Priests,) &ldquo;Is it not unfair
to charge a whole body with the act of a solitary
individual?&nbsp; Would it be fair to the Church of England to
identify her, as a body, with the indiscretion or sin of any one
of her ministers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it were true that there were nothing in the doctrines or
laws of the Church of Rome to identify her with this act, then I
should acknowledge the force of the objection; I should fully
acknowledge that it would be grossly unfair to charge on any body
the act of an isolated individual, unless there were something in
the principles, in the laws, or in the practices, of that body
which accorded with it.</p>
<p>But a still stronger objection may occur to your minds, after
the acknowledgment of the Romish Priests.&nbsp; You may say,
&ldquo;Is not this document signed by the priest who burnt the
Testament?&nbsp; Would it not therefore be more generous and more
Christian, when he who has done wrong acknowledges his error and
expresses his sorrow, to accept his apology and be
silent?&rdquo;&nbsp; This objection, I feel, must be
answered.</p>
<p>Now with regard to the reply of the &ldquo;Catholic
Clergy&rdquo; as they style themselves, it admits the fact,
namely, that a New Testament was burnt.&nbsp; And in candour we
are to take it for granted that the Priest expresses his regret
for having said he would burn other Bibles at any future
time.&nbsp; You will remark however, by the way, (though I shall
not now dwell upon it,) that there is not a word of regret for
the utterance of the threat of scurrilous and abusive
language.&nbsp; Not one word is said in reference to this
point&mdash;that a man calling himself a minister, not of <i>a
branch</i> of Christ&rsquo;s Church, but of <i>the Catholic</i>
Church, tells a Protestant Clergyman, in the precincts of his own
parish, in the house of one of his parishioners, that though he
shall not advise any to resort to violence against his person, he
shall encourage them to <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>use scurrilous and insulting language
towards him, if he attempts to pass the door.</p>
<p>But to return to the burning of the Testament.</p>
<p>Making every allowance for the members of a Church who regard
the Protestant version as erroneous, I am prepared to show you
that this is not a solitary instance of such proceedings in the
Romish Church.&nbsp; And therefore it is that, notwithstanding
the public expression of regret now read to you, I feel justified
in dwelling upon this point.&nbsp; During the past week I
received a visit from a Protestant Clergyman from Ireland.&nbsp;
I was mentioning this incident to him, and he began to narrate to
me one or two other facts of a similar kind.&nbsp; I appeared
interested in the subject, and, without any solicitation on my
part, yesterday morning, as I was reading the apology of the
Priests, the post brought me a letter from this gentlemen,
wherein he narrates the circumstance which occurred in the parish
of which he was once Curate.&nbsp; I should say, that I have the
names of place and persons in my hand and am quite prepared to
give them up if necessary.&nbsp; He says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When I was curate in the parish of &mdash;,
diocese of Cork, my esteemed rector the &mdash; established a
scriptural school in the parish of &mdash; which was attended by
a considerable number of Roman Catholic children.&nbsp; A Father
&mdash; the parish priest, visited the house of a man named
Sullivan, whose daughter went to our school.&nbsp; Mr. &mdash;
asked how the little girl was improving, and said he wished to
hear her read.&nbsp; She brought him her Bible, which he no
sooner saw than he made a rush at her, snatched it out of her
hand, called in the neighbours to warm themselves by the light of
a &ldquo;Bible fire,&rdquo; and then burned it, and heaped the
fire to make the blaze the brighter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If any person present wishes to see the names he is perfectly
at liberty to do so to-morrow morning at my house.&nbsp; I merely
mention the circumstance, to show that the Bible-burning in St.
Peter&rsquo;s district is not a solitary instance.</p>
<p>Before however I go to the main line of argument which I shall
endeavour to pursue, I will mention a fact which occurred in my
own parish, not a hundred yards from this spot, the truth of
which a person present is prepared to substantiate on oath.&nbsp;
One of my Scripture Readers, in the course of his visits among
the poor Irish, found a considerable number of them almost or
entirely unable to read.&nbsp; He came to me (though teaching
them to read was no part of his duty, but merely to read to them)
to ask whether I should have any objection to his teaching them
to read as they seemed willing to learn.&nbsp; I allowed him to
purchase a few elementary reading Books; not Testaments or
Bibles.&nbsp; He went three or four Sundays, and some of his
scholars seemed willing and thankful to avail themselves of the
privilege.&nbsp; At last he found they began to look somewhat shy
on him.&nbsp; He told them to show the <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Priest the books from which they were
learning to read.&nbsp; The books were produced, and the priest
said there was no harm in the books themselves but <i>they would
lead to the Bible</i>.&nbsp; And, as if to form a complete
counterpart to the case in St. Peter&rsquo;s district, as if
scurrility and insult were to be added to the burning of
God&rsquo;s Word, my Scripture Reader was actually kicked, not by
a Priest, but by an Irishman, as he went out of the Court, who
used the strongest language, and exclaimed &ldquo;Break his
neck!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">It would lead to
the Bible</span>!&rdquo;&nbsp; And these poor Irish are doubtless
still unable to read, though had my Scripture Reader been
permitted to pursue his labours, there is no doubt that by this
time they would have been fully able to do so.</p>
<p>Before I pass on to the views and conduct of the Church of
Rome in reference to her own versions, I would bring before you
the language in which Rome speaks of <i>our</i> endeavours to
circulate our Scriptures.</p>
<p>You are invited to-night by a seasonable coincidence, to
attend a Bible Meeting in the School Room of the very District in
which the circumstance which gives rise to this discourse
occurred; and I trust if any of you are lukewarm about the Bible
Society, you will feel that it is high time for us to meet to
circulate the Word of truth, when Priests are burning it.&nbsp;
Now what is the language of Rome towards the Bible Society?</p>
<blockquote><p>Pius VIIth calls the Bible Society &ldquo;a most
crafty device by which the very foundations of religion are
undermined&mdash;a pestilence&mdash;a defilement of the faith
most imminently dangerous to souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leo XII. declares of it &ldquo;That it strolls with effrontery
through the world, contemning the traditions of the Holy Fathers,
and contrary to the well-known decree of the council of Trent,
labours with all its might and by every means to translate or
rather pervert the Holy Bible into the vulgar language of every
nation, from which proceeding it is greatly to be feared that
what is ascertained to have happened to some passages may also
occur with regard to others: to wit that by a perverse
interpretation the gospel of Christ is turned into a human
gospel, or what is still worse into the gospel of the <span
class="GutSmall">DEVIL</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the same effect is the language of the present Pope in one
of his Encyclical Letters. <a name="citation8"></a><a
href="#footnote8" class="citation">[8]</a></p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>But I
acknowledge that all this does not apply to the main point which
I desire to urge this evening.&nbsp; The question that now
presents itself is &ldquo;what is the practice of the Church of
Rome in reference to the possession of the Scriptures by their
people, even in their own received versions.&rdquo;&nbsp; And one
of the reasons why I am not satisfied with this document issued
by the Romish Priests, is, that it would seem to imply&mdash;(I
acknowledge it is not <i>stated</i>, but I ask any man of common
sense what would be the impression produced on his mind on
reading this acknowledgment) that the Church of Rome does
circulate the Scriptures generally?&nbsp; I ask any candid man,
would not you conclude and infer from their words, that the only
objection of the Romish Church is to the circulation of <i>what
they consider erroneous versions</i>, <i>but that they are
endeavouring to circulate their own</i>?&nbsp; I appeal to your
judgments whether what I say is not a fair and legitimate
inference from their language.&nbsp; I believe, in my conscience,
that it is intended to convey that impression.</p>
<p>Now let us examine carefully&mdash;and I earnestly crave
<i>your</i> attention to this point, my Roman Catholic
hearers&mdash;what is the language of your Church?&nbsp; You
shall not have <i>my</i> words.&nbsp; I will give you the words
of <i>your own Church</i>.&nbsp; And I presume I am not saying
anything which a member of the Church of Rome will deny.&nbsp; <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Nor am I
relying on an authority which the Church of Rome can now
repudiate.&nbsp; For before I read the extract which I am about
to read to you from an Italian writer, it is necessary that I
should prove to you that the writer is one fully recognised and
endorsed by the Church of Rome.&nbsp; It appears that on the 26th
of May, being Trinity Sunday, 1839, Alphonsus Liguori was
canonised at Rome, that is to say, he was admitted into the
muster roll of the Saints of the Roman Catholic Church.&nbsp; On
the 18th of May, 1803, Pius VII confirmed the decree of the
sacred College of the Jesuits, which declared that all the
writings of St. Alphonsus had been most rigorously examined, and
I beg you to mark what follows&mdash;&ldquo;That not one
word&rdquo; (after this rigorous examination) &ldquo;<i>not one
word had been found worthy of censure</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I think
then what I can bring forward from writings thus examined, from
writings which have been thus broadly endorsed and declared free
from censure, from the writings of a man who has been recently
canonised, may safely be dealt with as recognised by the Church
of Rome.</p>
<p>Many of you are aware that certain books are prohibited to her
people.&nbsp; There is a congregation called the
&ldquo;Congregation of the Index,&rdquo; appointed to examine
books to put them into the class of prohibited works.&nbsp; Will
you believe the fact that &ldquo;<span class="smcap">the Word of
God</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Protestants!&nbsp; Romanists! let it sink
deeply into your hearts&mdash;<span class="smcap">the Word of
God</span>!&mdash;not in the Protestant translation, not in a
heretical version, but the <span class="smcap">Word of God</span>
as received by the Church of Rome&mdash;is <span class="smcap">in
the Romish Index of prohibited books</span>!&nbsp; I do not ask
you to take my word for a fact so incredible.&nbsp; Rome shall
speak for herself.&nbsp; Here are the words of the
Index.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Since it is manifest by experience that if
the Holy Bibles are allowed everywhere without difference in the
vulgar tongue, more harm than good would arise from it on account
of the rashness of men.&nbsp; Let the judgment of the Bishop or
inquisitor be abided by in this matter, so that with the advice
of the parish priest or confessor <i>they may grant</i> the
reading of the Bible in the vulgar tongue, translated by Catholic
authors to those whom they shall have ascertained to be likely to
derive no harm, but rather an increase of faith and piety from
this sort of reading, <i>which permission they must have in
writing</i>; <i>but if any one shall presume to read or possess
them without such permission</i>, <i>he may not receive
absolution of his sins unless he first deliver up the Bibles to
the ordinary</i>.</p>
<p>From Pope Pius 4th, we have the following cautionary
rule&mdash;That since it is manifest from experience that if the
Bible be indiscriminately permitted in the vulgar tongue, more
injury than benefit will result through the rashness of men, the
use of Catholic versions <i>shall be granted</i> by the voice of
the priest or confessor to those alone who it is understood will
not be hurt by the reading of them, but will be advanced in faith
and piety.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;&ldquo;<i>they may
grant</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>shall be
granted</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;Man giving permission to read the
Bible!&nbsp; That is, on Romanist principles, if one of you, my
parishioners, wants to read the Bible, he must come to me, as his
Rector, for permission&mdash;for a written certificate!</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Mark
also the <i>condemnation</i> by Pope Clement XI of a proposition
made by an eminent writer (Quesnel) of the Romish Church.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is useful and necessary in every time,
in every place, and for every degree of persons, to study and to
know the spirit, and piety, and mysteries of the Sacred
Scriptures.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was laid down by Quesnel, and Pope Clement condemned
it.</p>
<p>But I ask &ldquo;Is it a fact that in this very town, where we
have a considerable number of Romanists, the Scriptures are
disseminated <i>in the Romish version</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; One of
the excuses which might be urged for the Priest is, that the
Testament which was burnt by him was not the authorised
version.&nbsp; Two or three weeks have elapsed since he burnt
that one, but has he given, in its place, one of his own
Testaments?&nbsp; He had not done it up to yesterday
morning.&nbsp; What! has he burnt the Testament of a little child
without the slightest restitution?&nbsp; Had I taken away what I
deemed an erroneous version, at least I should have gone to the
first Bible depository and should have said &ldquo;At any rate,
if I take away what I consider erroneous <i>I must supply what I
think is right</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; On his own showing, he was bound
to have given the child a New Testament <i>according to the
Romish version</i>.</p>
<p>But it will be said, &ldquo;There are many towns where you can
buy the Romish version of the Scriptures at their
booksellers.&rdquo;&nbsp; I can attribute this to nothing else
than that Rome skilfully accommodates herself to circumstances of
time and place.&nbsp; This remark will be deemed uncharitable by
many.&nbsp; Brethren, it is not very easy to avoid the appearance
of uncharitableness when speaking of the practises of the Church
of Rome.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dr. Dens, having given the Fourth Rule of
the Index, and stated that it is strictly binding in Romish
countries, says&mdash;&lsquo;Yea, rather according to Steyaeret,
the law (4th rule of Index) was received and hitherto observed
(with some variety, according to the peculiar genius of nations),
in by far the greatest portion of the Catholic world, nay, in the
whole of that part of the world which is completely Catholic:
<i>it was more dispensed with only where Catholics lived among
heretics</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation11a"></a><a
href="#footnote11a" class="citation">[11a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where the Protestant Bible is extensively circulated, there
you will find the Romish Scriptures may be purchased.</p>
<p>But, in the face of the hundreds here to-night, I state it as
a fact which may be substantiated by superabundant evidence, that
the Church of Rome is still, as by her own showing she is not
ashamed to own, opposed to the general circulation of the Word of
God in the vernacular tongue, even according to her own received
version. <a name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a>&nbsp; And now let us <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>inquire into
the reasons for this conduct.&nbsp; The first is, as the words
just quoted bear me out in asserting that <i>they consider that
danger and mischief would arise from the general circulation of
the Word of God among the masses of the People</i>.&nbsp; Men and
Brethren! I desire to put a bridle on my spirit and on my tongue
to-night, but when I hear a man telling me that the Word of the
living God&mdash;that that revelation which our Heavenly Father
has graciously given to us his fallen sinful creatures, to tell
us of his love, to make known his will, and to declare the way of
salvation&mdash;that this is to be denied to the masses of the
people, I feel within me (I trust a <i>holy</i>)
indignation.&nbsp; Why is it not the very glory of the Word of
God&mdash;is it not one of the best evidences of its adaptation
to the wants of man&mdash;that while there are mysteries which
neither a Bacon, nor a Newton, nor a Locke could fathom, and into
which even an archangel can but desire to <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>look&mdash;there are lessons which the simplest can
fully understand, which a Timothy may learn at his mother&rsquo;s
knees.&nbsp; Is it not a blessed and irrefragable proof of the
fact that God intended <i>all</i> to have the Bible&mdash;that
the Bible in its great and vital truths (I do not say its every
mystery) is open, under the teaching of the Holy Spirit, not
merely to the Priest or to the scholar, but to the most ignorant
of men?&nbsp; And I will venture to assert that, so far from the
Bible being above the comprehension of an uneducated man,
whenever you find such an one become a humble, prayerful, reader
of the Bible, it expands and strengthens the powers of his
mind.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; You will find in the courts and alleys of
this vast town, many a man who could not discourse to you of this
world&rsquo;s lore, but his eye would kindle, his mind would be
all intelligence, and his tongue all fluency, as he began to talk
of the wondrous themes of the Word of God.</p>
<p>It is to me one of the strongest proofs that the Bible is the
Word of God, that the mind of the most ignorant cannot come into
contact with it without becoming elevated thereby:&mdash;<i>The
testimony of the Lord is sure</i>, <i>making wise the
simple</i>:&mdash;<i>The entrance of thy words giveth light</i>;
<i>it giveth understanding unto the simple</i>.</p>
<p>But a second reason for the non-circulation of the Written
Word by the Church of Rome, is that <i>she does not regard it as
the alone standard of faith and practice</i>.&nbsp; Hear one of
her champions.&nbsp; You will not find that the Church of Rome
repudiates Dr. Wiseman.&nbsp; He plainly says&mdash;&ldquo;The
Protestant asserts, and the Catholic denies, that God intended
the Scriptures to be the rule of faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hear also the decree of the Council of Trent&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Having constantly in view the removal of
error and the preservation of the purity of the gospel in the
church, which gospel promised before by the prophets in the
sacred scriptures, was first orally published by our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, who afterwards commanded it to be
preached by his Apostles to every creature, as the source of all
saving truth and discipline, and perceiving that this truth and
discipline are contained both in written books and unwritten
traditions which have come down to us, either received by the
Apostles from the lips of Christ himself, or transmitted by the
hands of the same Apostles under the direction of the Holy
Spirit, following the example of the orthodox fathers, this
Council doth receive and reverence, <i>with equal piety and
veneration</i>, all the books, as well of the Old as of the New
Testament, the same God being the author of both; <i>and also the
aforesaid traditions</i>, pertaining both to faith and manners,
whether received from Christ himself, or dictated by the Holy
Spirit, and preserved in the Catholic Church by continual
succession.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank God for the contrast which we can present between Rome
and our Protestant Church!&nbsp; What then is the language of our
own Church?&mdash;&ldquo;Holy Scripture containeth all things
necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein,
nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that
it should be believed as an article of Faith, or be thought
requisite or necessary to <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>salvation.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Article</span> vi.&nbsp; And then again in the XXth
Article she says&mdash;&ldquo;The Church hath power to decree
rites or ceremonies, and authority in controversies of
faith,&rdquo;&mdash;(the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; is rendered
in the Latin Articles not by a word signifying <i>imperial</i>,
<i>absolute</i>, authority, but <i>weight</i>,
<i>influence</i>,)&mdash;&ldquo;and yet it is not lawful for the
Church to ordain anything that is contrary to God&rsquo;s Word
written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that
it be repugnant to another.&nbsp; Wherefore although the Church
be a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ, yet, as it ought not to
decree anything against the same, so besides the same ought it
not to enforce anything to be believed for necessity of
salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men and Brethren beloved! let this be distinctly impressed
upon your minds&mdash;that the universal right of the
laity&mdash;yes, of the uneducated part of the laity&mdash;to the
Word of God, in their own tongue, is a distinctive principle of
the blessed Reformation.&nbsp; As it was the Bible which
contributed mainly to enlighten and emancipate the mind of the
great Luther, so have the translation and circulation of the
Bible in the vulgar tongue been co-extensive with the progress of
true religion in this country, since the Reformation.&nbsp; From
the time when the large Bible stood in the Parish Church, with
its chain to secure it; when the multitudes who wanted to read
the Word of God had to flock there and to wait in turns to get to
the sacred treasure, or one had to be the reader for the rest;
from that time down to the present, when the Christian Knowledge
Society, the British and Foreign Bible Society, and other
Institutions have successively given their aid, the Word of the
Lord has had free course and been glorified.</p>
<p>And now I submit that I have proved, my case against the
Church of Rome.&nbsp; I have shown that the act which,
notwithstanding the explanation of the Priests, has excited the
astonishment and indignation of Protestants throughout this town,
does not stand alone.&nbsp; And more, that even the version which
is authorised by the Romish Church is not permitted to be
generally read, without the permission of a Priest or authorised
person.</p>
<p>Without saying one word which is not entirely consistent with
Christian charity, I now ask of you, whether that Church is more
in accordance with the will of God, which tells you that, before
you read his Word in private, you must have the written
permission of the Priest&mdash;or that Church which, without
exception or reserve, puts into the hand of her every member the
written Word of God?&nbsp; What, I would ask, was the language of
David?&nbsp; He was not a Priest&mdash;&ldquo;O how love I thy
law! it is my meditation all the day.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor
Romanist, unless he has the written permission of his Priest
cannot, amid his troubles and his sorrows, say with David,
&ldquo;Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my
pilgrimage.&rdquo;&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Psalm</span> cxix.
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>54.)&nbsp;
Remember too what is said of the Bereans, when they heard Paul
preach&mdash;&ldquo;These were more noble than those in
Thessolonica, in that they received the word with all gladness of
mind, and <span class="GutSmall">SEARCHED THE SCRIPTURES
DAILY</span>, whether these things were so.&rdquo;&mdash;(<span
class="smcap">Acts</span> xvii. 11.)&nbsp; No Romanist will
assert that his Priest is superior to St. Paul.&nbsp; But what
did the Bereans do when Paul preached to them?&nbsp; They
&ldquo;<span class="GutSmall">SEARCHED THE SCRIPTURES
DAILY</span>&rdquo; to see whether he was preaching truth.&nbsp;
And I tell you that if St. Paul himself, yea, if an angel were to
preach to me, I would do the same.&nbsp; But what would be said
to a poor Irishman who should go to his Priest and say &ldquo;I
have been looking to my Bible to see what is said there about
what you told us yesterday, and I find that what you taught us is
not according to the Word of God?&rdquo;&nbsp; And what does St.
Paul say when warning Timothy in his second Epistle (iii. 14, 17)
against &ldquo;perilous times&rdquo; and evil men?&nbsp;
&ldquo;All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness, that&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Who</i>? the
priest?&mdash;the scholar?&mdash;No!&mdash;&ldquo;That the <span
class="smcap">man of God</span>&rdquo;&mdash;whether priest or
layman, whether scholar or no scholar&mdash;&ldquo;may be
perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And contrast his language to Timothy with the case of the little
girl from the Industrial School&mdash;&ldquo;From a child thou
hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise
unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ
Jesus.&rdquo;&mdash;There were no Bible-burners in St.
Paul&rsquo;s days.&nbsp; The little girl in Birmingham receives a
Testament, and it is not only taken away, but is burnt by the
Priest.&nbsp; We read in the Epistle for this morning&rsquo;s
service &ldquo;Whatsoever things were written aforetime <i>were
written for our learning</i>, that we through patience, and
comfort of the scriptures might have hope.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
evident therefore that they were not written to be kept back from
the people, but that they were &ldquo;<i>written for their
learning</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation15"></a><a
href="#footnote15" class="citation">[15]</a>&nbsp; Yet the Church
of Rome which arrogates to itself the title of the only true
Church puts the Bible into the Index of prohibited books.&nbsp;
One more example which the Scriptures furnish&mdash;the example
of the Ethiopian Eunuch. (Acts viii. 27, &amp;c.)&nbsp; He was
sitting in his carriage, reading <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>his Bible, and God sent his minister
to him saying&mdash;&ldquo;Understandest thou what thou
readest?&rdquo;&nbsp; Beautiful illustration of a
minister&rsquo;s place!&nbsp; It is to explain the
Scriptures.&nbsp; He did not say &ldquo;You cannot understand
them&mdash;You ought not to be reading Esaias the
prophet.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he took it out of his hands, it was not
to throw it either into the fire or into the water, but he took
the book from him and &ldquo;<i>began at the same scripture and
preached unto him Jesus</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this is our office
now, not to stand between the people and the Bible, but to open
up the Bible to them, grounding our every sermon, our every
lecture, our every lesson, upon it.</p>
<p>I proceed, Brethren beloved, to draw from this mournful
occurrence practical lessons, and, in doing so, I trust I shall
not violate the rule which, in perfect sincerity, I laid down at
the commencement.&nbsp; Of course, the Romanist will think I am
violating it, as will some latitudinarian Protestants.</p>
<p>But, I urge, learn from this transaction in our town the
<i>true unaltered character of Popery</i>.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;though
many haply do not like that statement, I repeat it&mdash;<i>the
true unaltered character of Popery</i>.&nbsp; We are
<i>bigots</i> forsooth! which was the bigot?&mdash;the man that
gave the <i>Bible</i> or he that burnt it?</p>
<p>Mark the published statement of the Priests.&nbsp; I am to be
told that, put as I am, in some measure, at least, in charge (in
accordance with the laws of this country,) over the souls of the
people in my parish without exception, I am not to go into the
houses of some of my parishioners; or, if I do so, I am to be
treated with <i>scurrility</i> and <i>insult</i>!&nbsp; Let me
ask you, does any man or woman here believe that there is a
Protestant Clergyman or a Dissenting Minister who would have said
that if any Romish Priest came into the house of one of his
people he was to be treated with <i>scurrility</i> and
<i>insult</i>?&nbsp; I can only say from the depth of my heart
that I should be utterly ashamed of any Protestant Clergyman who
so disgraced himself.&nbsp; We are told however by the Priest
that if we venture to pass the door of a Roman Catholic we shall
be treated with &ldquo;<i>scurrility</i> and
<i>insult</i>&rdquo;&mdash;I repeat the words because I was
careful to ask the Incumbent of St. Peter&rsquo;s for <i>the very
words</i> employed.&nbsp; But are we to receive this doctrine? is
there any man in this country except the owner of the house or
tenement&mdash;be it among the humble tenements of London
&rsquo;Prentice-street, or the villas of Edgbaston&mdash;who has
the power to say to me that I shall not enter that house?&nbsp;
Is it come to this, that, in these days of freedom, in the 19th
century, I am not to be at liberty to enter the house of one of
my parishioners, whether he be a Roman Catholic or Protestant,
(so long as the householder permits my visit) without receiving
scurrility and insult at the instance of a Priest!&nbsp; I, for
one, unhesitatingly declare, and I believe I shall be supported
in the declaration <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>by the body of my brethren, that I do not mean to abide
by any such rule.</p>
<p>But the Priest was provoked, forsooth, by the conduct of
certain Protestant Clergymen and their agents who enter the house
of the poor Romanist, to pervert his faith!&nbsp; The charge is
that we are making proselytes.&nbsp; If by this it be meant that
we are trying to get people over from one Church to another, I
demur to it.&nbsp; It is my object, with God&rsquo;s assistance,
to make them Christians, to draw them to Christ, but I wish to
make them <i>converts</i> and not <i>proselytes</i>.&nbsp; I wish
indeed to see them Church of England Christians, because I
believe that my own dear Church exhibits Christ in her Articles
and formularies, and is a truly Scriptural Church.&nbsp; But I
confess that I was almost provoked to a smile when I read of
<i>the complaints of Rome</i> that we are seeking to
proselytise!&nbsp; Rome which is literally setting wife against
husband, daughter against father, by the most insidious
artifices; perverting Protestants, and even the children of
Protestant Clergymen, by artifices the most subtle!&nbsp; Rome
which is not content with contesting the ground with us in our
own land but in heathen countries also, as well as in our
colonies!&nbsp; The charge of proselytising comes with a very bad
grace from the Church of Rome!&nbsp; Let me however say that
though I do not wish to <i>proselytize</i> but to <i>convert</i>,
I will not undertake to keep my Scripture Readers out of any
house at the dictation of Priest or Pope.&nbsp; I will not
undertake to leave men in error and darkness.&nbsp; Let us use
lawful, open handed, means, let us not have recourse to subtle
artifice.&nbsp; Let us have all as open as the day, and I have no
fear for the ultimate progress of the truth.&nbsp; And we ask all
members of the Church of Rome to confine themselves to
honourable, straightforward, proceedings.</p>
<p>It will perhaps be said that in what I am now about to urge I
am trenching on party politics.&nbsp; I appeal to my two
years&rsquo; ministrations in this town, whether I have at any
time been guilty of advancing anything in the shape of party
politics.&nbsp; But there are some questions in which politics
and religion are so intimately blended, that I hold it to be
false delicacy to abstain from the bold avowal of our
sentiments.&nbsp; I put it to you&mdash;are we prepared to pay
money to the Romish Priests for burning Bibles in Ireland or in
England, without a manful, constitutional, struggle?&nbsp; I know
that if you deviate from the simple ground of principle, and
begin to talk of <i>expediency</i>, a strong case may readily be
made.&nbsp; On grounds of expediency, I myself should be disposed
to yield, but <i>as a sworn minister of the Church of
England</i>, <i>I have proclaimed Rome to be</i> <span
class="GutSmall">IDOLATROUS</span>; <i>and if you are ashamed of
your Church</i>, I <span class="GutSmall">AM NOT</span>; and I
will not consent, either directly or indirectly, to support
idolatry&mdash;I will not consent to pay money for a Priest who
goes into London &rsquo;Prentice-street or into Ireland to burn
the Word of God.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>But
bear with me awhile, while I advance my <i>second</i>
lesson.&nbsp; <i>Be thankful for the Protestant Reformed Church
of England</i>.&nbsp; We are not half thankful enough for the
Church of England.&nbsp; And though some of our Dissenting
enemies desire to pull her down, they little know how much they
risk.&nbsp; They little know what a protective position the
Church of England occupies between them and the tyranny of Rome.
<a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a>&nbsp; Whatever the Church of England
may have been in times gone by, and I do not say that the bitter
weed of bigotry is entirely eradicated, yet she is now
practically a tolerant Church.</p>
<p>But it is the fashion of the day to decry
<i>Protestantism</i>, &ldquo;Protestantism is a mere
negation!&rdquo;&nbsp; We do not mean to say that Protestantism
will take a man to heaven.&nbsp; But we <i>do</i> say that it is
the glory of our Church that, when the truth of God had been
overlaid with error and corruption, she came out of the
corruption herself, and made a bold protest against it.&nbsp; Let
us not be ashamed of the name Protestant.&nbsp; We want not
Protestantism as a mere toast at a jovial dinner&mdash;as the
mere shibboleth of a party.&nbsp; Our Protestantism is a
<i>holy</i> thing.&nbsp; It is a protest against the corruption
of the truth of God.&nbsp; And, if you love Protestantism,
<i>dally</i> not with <i>Popery</i>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go to
Roman Catholic Chapels to hear the pretty music!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t let your children have tales and novels which contain
poison, simply because they are nicely got up and
illustrated.&nbsp; A man may drink poison out of a golden cup;
but it is poison still.&nbsp; Your only safety is to have nothing
to do with it.&nbsp; Touch not the unclean thing.</p>
<p>Thirdly.&mdash;<i>Circulate the Scriptures</i>.&nbsp; If you
cannot do it by your own individual exertions, join those
Institutions which are established for this purpose.&nbsp; Join
the Christian Knowledge Society; join the British and Foreign
Bible Society.&nbsp; Support our Parish Scripture Readers&rsquo;
fund; and if the emissaries of Rome are going up and down in our
town, let us at least be equally diligent; and ask whether we
ought not to determine to have an enlarged band of Scripture
Readers to counteract their efforts.</p>
<p>Fourthly.&mdash;Remember the solemn privilege and
responsibility of possessing the Bible.&nbsp; It is a privilege
to possess the Bible; but that privilege entails an awful
responsibility.&nbsp; For when the Lord Jesus shall come a second
time, to judge the world, he will demand an account, not merely
from the Priest who burns the Bible, but the Protestant who
neglects it.&nbsp; A neglected Bible is as bad as a burnt
Bible.&nbsp; At the last day, it would be better for us to have
been members of a Church which withheld the Word of God from its
people, than, having <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>the Word, to have neglected and
despised it.&nbsp; All you that have the Scriptures in your
houses, first given perhaps by some affectionate parent, now no
more&mdash;Servants, to whom some kind and pious Mistress has
given a copy of the Word of God, which you have left
unread&mdash;you little Children who have received a copy of this
Holy Book in the Sunday or the National School&mdash;beware lest
the Word of God neglected and despised should rise up against you
at the last great day.&nbsp; Beware, lest, being Protestants in
name, ye be wanting in Bible faith, Bible hope, Bible lives.</p>
<p>Before I sit down, I desire to address another portion of the
congregation to-night.</p>
<p>My Roman Catholic hearers, you have not often listened to a
Protestant preacher.&nbsp; Perhaps you may never listen to
another.&nbsp; And perhaps from what you have read of speeches
and sermons against Romanism, you think that we are one and all
fire-brands, cherishing and indulging bitter animosity against
you.</p>
<p>I am free to acknowledge, and I say it with all honesty, that
I much regret the way in which some persons talk about
Romanists.&nbsp; I believe that a great many rash and bitter
words have been employed; much that is inconsistent in the sight
of God with Christian charity.&nbsp; I admit this, but let me
also say that you must learn to distinguish between language
against <i>your system</i> and language against
<i>yourselves</i>.&nbsp; We <i>do</i> believe your system to be
idolatrous.&nbsp; We <i>do</i> believe it to be opposed in many
essential points to the Word of God.&nbsp; And though there be
some traitors in our camp who eat our bread and want to
fraternize with you, we tell you that the great body of the
Protestant Churchmen of England have no sympathy with these
traitors.&nbsp; But I earnestly invite your candid attention
while I solemnly ask you one question.&nbsp; <i>Does your Church
circulate the Word of God</i>?&nbsp; I do not say does your
Church, in some particular cases, withhold her objection? but as
a Church is it a <i>Bible-circulating</i> Church?&nbsp; I am
dealing with fellow immortals, fellow sinners.&nbsp; Let me a
moment put aside the distinctions of Protestant and
Romanist.&nbsp; Let us, my Roman Catholic hearers, recollect that
we are both poor worms of the earth&mdash;with immortal
souls&mdash;passing into an awful eternity&mdash;an eternity into
which you and I may be plunged speedily.&nbsp; I say unto you
then, as dying men and fellow sinners, that all is not right, if
your Church or your Priests stand between you and the Word of
God.&nbsp; I say to you, though the Pope himself preach to you,
&ldquo;<i>Search the Scriptures</i>&rdquo; for yourselves; assert
the right of examining the Word of God.&nbsp; I do not say to you
&ldquo;Become a Protestant,&rdquo; &ldquo;Become this, become the
other;&rdquo; all I now say is &ldquo;<i>Search the
Scriptures</i>&rdquo; with honest, hearty, humble, childlike
prayer.&nbsp; Search them &ldquo;<i>daily</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
will enable you to test the rules and doctrines of the Church of
Rome.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>When
you turn to your Bibles, you will find the <i>Virgin Mary</i>
there.&nbsp; You will find her there as &ldquo;highly
favoured&rdquo; and blessed among women&mdash;but you will
<i>not</i> find her as a mediator between yourself and her
Incarnate Son; you will <i>not</i> find her as the object in any
sense or measure, of religious worship.&nbsp; And when you turn
to your Bibles, you will find <i>Confession</i> there&mdash;but
you will <i>not</i> find confession to your priest necessarily
enjoined; you will <i>not</i> find that, in order to absolution,
you are bound to open to a fellow man all the secrets of your
inmost soul.&nbsp; On Calvary alone, and at the foot of the
cross, must you confess your sins.&nbsp; And when you turn to
your Bibles, you will find <i>Good Works</i> there&mdash;but you
will not find good works to have in any measure an atoning
efficacy&mdash;but that we are justified by faith without the
deeds of the law.&nbsp; And when you turn to your Bibles, you
will find in them the blessed truth that the Lord Jesus Christ
died on the cross for sinners&mdash;but you will <i>not</i> find
the doctrine of the mass there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Christ was
<i>once</i> offered to bear the sins of
many.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;By <i>one</i> offering he hath
<i>perfected for ever</i> them that are sanctified;&rdquo; and
that offering is never to be, and never can be, repeated.&nbsp;
When you turn to your Bibles you will find that in the Sacrament
of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper we do, in a <i>spiritual</i> sense, by
faith, eat the body and drink the blood of our Lord Jesus
Christ&mdash;but you will <i>not</i> find that by the prayer of
the Priest, common sense is contradicted, and the bread, and the
juice of the vine, turned into the body and blood of the Son of
Man.</p>
<p>Beloved, all I ask of you is to test these things by
Scripture, and when you have done this, compare the Church of
England with that of Rome, and may the Spirit of God be with you
as your helper and your guide!</p>
<p>This congregation is now about to separate.&nbsp; The Roman
Catholic who is here, will perhaps never more set foot within
these walls.&nbsp; But remember we shall meet again at the last
great day.&nbsp; On that solemn day no priest can stand in your
stead; no Church doctrines or dogmas can be put in as your plea
or excuse before your Judge.&nbsp; You will stand in the presence
of Him who made you and hath redeemed you.&nbsp; And if I have
seemed to speak bitterly, believe me, in these last words, it is
my soul&rsquo;s inmost prayer for every Romanist here present
to-night, that, if he be not brought out of that Church before
that solemn hour when the wood and hay and stubble shall be burnt
up by the judgment-fires, he may yet, spite of his Romanism, be
so found on the <span class="GutSmall">ONE
FOUNDATION</span>&mdash;even Jesus&mdash;as that we may meet in
the Church in glory!</p>

class="footnote">[5]</a>&nbsp; I subjoin the following documents,
issued since the preaching of this Sermon:&mdash;</p>
<p>At a Meeting of the Committee of the Birmingham Auxiliary to
the British and Foreign Bible Society, held December 11th,
1848.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>It was unanimously resolved</i>:</p>
<p>That the object of the British and Foreign Bible Society being
the circulation of the Word of God without note or comment, this
Committee cannot pass unnoticed the dishonour done to the Word of
God by the act of a Roman Catholic Priest in this town, who,
during the last month, burned a copy of the New Testament; nor
the attempt made by his coadjutors and himself in repudiating
that act, to excuse it in some respect, inasmuch as that excuse
rests upon principles which, carried out to their legitimate
conclusion, would infringe upon our undoubted right to circulate
the Word of God, wherever parties of any and of every creed are
willing to receive it.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
the Editor of Aris&rsquo;s Gazette</span>.</p>
<p>Sir&mdash;It is with much regret that I am obliged again to
come before the public on the subject of the Testament which was
burnt in London &rsquo;Prentice-street, in this town, by the Rev.
W. Molloy, a Priest of the Church of Rome, but the cause of truth
demands it of me. It is stated in the apology put forth by that
Rev. Gentleman and his coadjutors, &ldquo;that the act was
regretted afterwards by the Clergyman by whom it was done, and
strongly disapproved of by his brother Clergy as soon as
known,&rdquo; and that it was &ldquo;under the excitement of the
moment that the act, which it is not attempted to justify, was
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Sir, I ask you, as I ask the public, are these statements
consistent with the following facts:&mdash;The Testament was
burnt on Thursday, Nov. 16, about two o&rsquo;clock p.m., and it
was not till the following Saturday, about midday, that I had any
conversation with the Priest upon the subject.</p>
<p>Being in London &rsquo;Prentice-street on the Saturday, Mr.
Molloy sent for me to the house where he had burnt the Testament,
to ask if I supposed that the woman to whose daughter the book
had been given was a Protestant, because he had heard that I had
visited her the day before.&nbsp; It was upon that occasion that
I enquired of him whether or not he had burnt the Testament; he
told me that he had, and would burn every Bible and Tract he
found in the houses of his people.&nbsp; I warned him that I
should make his words public, and he told me I was perfectly
welcome to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; I further remember saying that I
had often been told that I had unjustly charged the Romish
Priests with denying the Bible to their people, and his reply was
to this effect&mdash;&ldquo;You have stated the truth, and are
perfectly welcome to state it when you will; you are furthering
our objects by doing so.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are several other
points in the apology on which I should much like to dwell, but I
think it best simply to state facts, and leave the public to
judge for themselves whether the apology that this act was done
in the excitement of the moment can apply to Mr. Molloy, who,
after the reflection of two days, threatened to repeat the act
again and again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I remain, Sir, your obedient
Servant,</p>

class="footnote">[8]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Hopes had been raised of a
new order of things, as a new Head, of a widely different
character from any of his predecessors, ascended the Papal
Throne.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;rail-roads and gas-lights shall be
admitted for the first time in the dominions of Him of Rome: but,
not the Bible Society; that shall be denounced with as loud a
voice of thunder, as ever proceeded from the City of the Seven
Hills.&nbsp; That voice of thunder has been re-echoed by
Cardinals and others, in France, Holland, and elsewhere; and so
re-echoed, that many a faint heart has quailed; and some, who
before stood half-prepared to encourage the dissemination of the
Scriptures, have drawn back and closed the door before
half-opened.&nbsp; And yet, even among Roman Catholics, the
distribution of the Scriptures has proved as large as
ever.&mdash;In no previous year has the Society been counted
worthy of suffering a fiercer vituperation from this quarter than
during the past.&nbsp; Take as an example, the following
paragraph from a famous Encyclical Letter, and see with what
company the Society is associated:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are already well acquainted, Venerable Brethren,
with other monsters of error, and the frauds with which the
children of the present age strive bitterly to beset the Catholic
religion and the Divine authority of the Church: to oppose its
laws, and to trample on the rights of the sacred as well as of
the civil power.&nbsp; To this point tend those guilty
conspiracies against the Roman Chair of the blessed Peter, on
which Christ laid the irremovable foundations of his
Church.&nbsp; To this point tend the operations of those secret
Societies, emerging from their native darkness for the ruin and
devastation of the common weal, as well sacred as social, who
have been again and again condemned with anathema by the Roman
Pontiffs our predecessors, in their Apostolic Letters, which we,
in the plentitude of our Apostolic power, confirm, and command to
be most strictly observed.&nbsp; This also is the tendency and
design of those insidious Bible Societies, which, renewing the
crafts of the ancient heretics, cease not to obtrude upon all
kinds of men, even the least instructed, gratuitously and at an
immense expense, copies in vast numbers of the Books of the
Sacred Scriptures, translated (against the holiest rules of the
Church) into various vulgar tongues, and very often with the most
perverse and erroneous interpretations; to the end that (Divine
tradition, the doctrine of the Fathers, and the authority of the
Catholic Church being rejected,) every man may interpret the
revelations of the Almighty according to his own private
judgement, and, perverting their sense, fall into the most
dangerous errors.&nbsp; Which Societies, emulous of his
predecessor, Gregory XVI., of blessed memory, (to whose place we
have been permitted to succeed, without his merits,) reproved by
his Apostolic Letter (16) and we desire equally to
condemn.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Forty-third Report of the British and
Foreign Bible Society</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p><a name="footnote11b"></a><a href="#citation11b"
class="footnote">[11b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;When Drs. Doyle, Murray,
and Kelley, the Irish Roman Catholic Bishops, were examined
before a committee of the Parliament, the following confessions
were made by them:&mdash;(<i>Question to Dr. Doyle</i>)&mdash;You
were educated in Portugal?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Did you ever see in
Portugal any translation (of the Scriptures) into the vulgar
tongue, whether allowed or not?&nbsp; No, I did not.&nbsp;
(<i>Question to Dr. Murray</i>)&mdash;You were educated in
Salamanca?&nbsp; I was.&nbsp; Can you give any information as to
any authenticated version of the scriptures in the Spanish
language?&nbsp; I did hear that there was a Spanish version of
the Holy Scriptures, but I do not happen to know the fact.&nbsp;
Have the Scriptures any practical circulation in the vulgar
tongue in Spain?&nbsp; They had not then.&nbsp; Have the people
seen the Scriptures in a language they could understand?&nbsp; I
believe they were not generally read by the people.&nbsp; Do you
imagine that any material portion of the people have so much as
seen the Scriptures in a language they could
understand?&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know that they have.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hear again extracts from the evidence of these Roman Catholic
Bishops before the Parliamentary Commissioners, 1825&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Ques.</i>&nbsp; Are the Commissioners to
collect that you think it improper for the children to read
through the Gospels and Acts?&nbsp; <i>Ans.</i>&nbsp; Without
explanation I think it is improper; I think no portion of
scripture ought to be read without being accompanied with
explanation and instruction.&nbsp; <i>Ques.</i>&nbsp; Is it a
venial or a mortal sin in an adult peasant to persevere in
reading the New Testament in the authorised version of the Church
of England, after his priest has forbidden it?&nbsp;
<i>Ans.</i>&nbsp; I should feel great delicacy in fixing the
amount of guilt which constitutes the one or the other.&nbsp;
<i>Ques.</i>&nbsp; Would you allow any of the peasantry of
Ireland who might persevere in reading the Scriptures in the
authorised version, after having been prohibited by your clergy,
to be received to the Sacrament?&nbsp; <i>Ans.</i>&nbsp; No, I
certainly would not.&nbsp; <i>Ques.</i>&nbsp; Should you think it
improper for such an individual to bury the Word of God?&nbsp;
<i>Ans.</i>&nbsp; I should be highly amused with such a
proceeding.&nbsp; <i>Ques.</i>&nbsp; Would you think him highly
deserving of approbation?&nbsp; <i>Ans.</i>&nbsp; I do not know
but I would: it might show a disposition which I would prize
highly, though I do not think the act a very laudable one, but
attending to the disposition more than the act itself, I would
reward the man.&nbsp; <i>Ques.</i>&nbsp; You would consider it in
the man a proof of orthodoxy?&nbsp; <i>Ans.</i>&nbsp; Yes, a
proof that he was filled with a right faith, only pushed to an
extreme.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now compare with these answers what Dr. Doyle said in his
evidence respecting the authorised version.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Though it has many errors I consider it one
of the noblest of works&mdash;one of the ablest translations that
has ever been produced.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>See No. IV. Tract of the
British Reformation Society</i>, <i>pages</i> 5, 6, 7.</p>
<p><a name="footnote15"></a><a href="#citation15"
class="footnote">[15]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Do we still then ask why
the Holy Scriptures were given to us by Divine Providence?&nbsp;
That question I conceive admits only of the following answer.
They are a gift to us and to our children, collectively and
individually, that we may lay them to our hearts, that they may
be to us our rule of life, and that by following their precepts
we may daily approach nearer and nearer to God.&nbsp; This I
repeat must be their great and primary object.&nbsp; They are not
then, nor were they ever intended to be, a hidden treasure,
hoarded up in the sanctuary of the Church, to be visited only on
solemn occasions, to be held up at a distance to the veneration
of the multitude, to serve only as a test of the accuracy of our
oral teaching, but they are at once the individual possession,
the personal friend, the monitor, the familiar oracle of every
servant of Christ.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Dr. Shuttleworth&rsquo;s Not
Tradition but Scripture</i>.</p>

<p><a name="footnote18"></a><a href="#citation18"

those of our Dissenting Brethren who refuse to take part in such
proceedings as those of the Anti-State Church Association,
publicly to repudiate, at least, their language and spirit.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
